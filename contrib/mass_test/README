This directory contains
* scripts to get from internet and extract Texinfo manuals. Some manuals are
  modified/fixed after extraction too.
* comparison of Perl, Perl with XS, and C texi2any implementation results. 
* comparison of input manual and manual recreated by parse_refold.pl, which
  should be exactly the same barring errors in manuals.


Preparing manuals
=================

get_manuals.sh: download manuals
extract_manuals.sh: extract manuals and postprocess some of them, fixing/adding

Comparison of Perl and C results
================================

Following two scripts are called by other scripts:
generate_perlVSC.sh: output HTML with texi2any.pl
generate_C.sh: output HTML with ctexi2any

setup_reference_perlVSC.sh: pure Perl HTML output with texi2any.pl
output_ConvertXS_perlVSC.sh: Perl with XS extension HTML output
output_convert_C.sh: C main program HTML output (with embedded Perl)

check_perlVSC.sh: compare Perl and XS, and XS and C (with embedded Perl)

Comparison of recreated manual
==============================

check_refold.sh: call parse_refold.pl and compare output with initial
manual.
