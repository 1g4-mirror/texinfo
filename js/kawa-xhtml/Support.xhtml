      <p>If you have a project that depends on Kawa or one of its component
packages, you might do well to get paid priority support from
Kawaâ€™s author.
</p>
      <p>The base price is $2400 for one year.  This entitles you to basic
support by email or phone.  Per <code class="email">&lt;<a class="email" href="mailto:per@bothner.com">per@bothner.com</a>&gt;</code> will answer techical
questions about Kawa or its implementation, investigate bug reports, and
suggest work-arounds.  I may (at my discretion) provide fixes and
enhancements (patches) for simple problems.  Response for support
requests received during the day (California time) will normally be
within a few hours.
</p>
      <p>All support requests must come through a single designated contact
person.  If Kawa is important to your business, you probably
want at least two contact people, doubling the price.
</p>
      <p>If the support contract is cancelled (by either party), remaining
time will be prorated and refunded.
</p>
      <p>Per is also available for development projects.
