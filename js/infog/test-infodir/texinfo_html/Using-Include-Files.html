<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-include"></a>

<p>To include another file within a Texinfo file, write the
<code class="code">@include</code> command at the beginning of a line and follow it on
the same line by the name of a file to be included.  For example:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">@include buffers.texi
</pre></div>

<p>@-commands are expanded in file names.  The one most likely to be
useful is <code class="code">@value</code> (see <a class="pxref" href="_0040set-_0040value.html"><code class="code">@set</code> and <code class="code">@value</code></a>), and even then
only in complicated situations.
</p>
<p>An included file should simply be a segment of text that you expect to
be included as is into the overall or <em class="dfn">outer</em> Texinfo file; it
should not contain the standard beginning and end parts of a Texinfo
file.  In particular, you should not start an included file with a
line saying &lsquo;<samp class="samp">\input texinfo</samp>&rsquo;; if you do, that text is inserted
into the output file literally.  Likewise, you should not end an
included file with a <code class="code">@bye</code> command; nothing after <code class="code">@bye</code>
is formatted.
</p>
<p>In the long-ago past, you were required to write an
<code class="code">@setfilename</code> line at the beginning of an included file, but no
longer.  Now, it does not matter whether you write such a line.  If an
<code class="code">@setfilename</code> line exists in an included file, it is ignored.
