<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-Catching-errors-with-TeX-formatting"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-Debugging-with-TeX-formatting"></a>

<p>You can also catch mistakes when you format a file with TeX.
</p>
<p>Usually, you will want to do this after you have run
<code class="code">texinfo-format-buffer</code> (or, better, <code class="code">makeinfo-buffer</code>) on
the same file, because <code class="code">texinfo-format-buffer</code> sometimes displays
error messages that make more sense than TeX.  (See <a class="xref" href="Debugging-with-Info.html">Catching Errors with Info Formatting</a>, for more information.)
</p>
<p>For example, TeX was run on a Texinfo file, part of which is shown
here:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">---------- Buffer: texinfo.texi ----------
name of the Texinfo file as an extension.  The
@samp{??} are `wildcards' that cause the shell to
substitute all the raw index files.  (@xref{sorting
indices, for more information about sorting
indices.)@refill
---------- Buffer: texinfo.texi ----------
</pre></div>

<p>(The cross-reference lacks a closing brace.)
TeX produced the following output, after which it stopped:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">---------- Buffer: *tex-shell* ----------
Runaway argument?
{sorting indices, for more information about sorting
indices.) @refill @ETC.
! Paragraph ended before @xref was complete.
&lt;to be read again&gt;
                  @par
l.27

?
---------- Buffer: *tex-shell* ----------
</pre></div>

<p>In this case, TeX produced an accurate and
understandable error message:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">Paragraph ended before @xref was complete.
</pre></div>

<p>&lsquo;<samp class="samp">@par</samp>&rsquo; is an internal TeX command of no relevance to Texinfo.
&lsquo;<samp class="samp">l.27</samp>&rsquo; means that TeX detected the problem on line 27 of the
Texinfo file.  The &lsquo;<samp class="samp">?</samp>&rsquo; is the prompt TeX uses in this
circumstance.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, TeX is not always so helpful, and sometimes you must
truly be a Sherlock Holmes to discover what went wrong.
</p>
<p>In any case, if you run into a problem like this, you can do one of three
things.
</p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li> You can tell TeX to continue running and ignore just this error by
typing <kbd class="key">RET</kbd> at the &lsquo;<samp class="samp">?</samp>&rsquo; prompt.

</li><li> You can tell TeX to continue running and to ignore all errors as best
it can by typing <kbd class="kbd">r <kbd class="key">RET</kbd></kbd> at the &lsquo;<samp class="samp">?</samp>&rsquo; prompt.

<p>This is often the best thing to do.  However, beware: the one error
may produce a cascade of additional error messages as its consequences
are felt through the rest of the file.  To stop TeX when it is
producing such an avalanche of error messages, type <kbd class="kbd">C-c</kbd> (or
<kbd class="kbd">C-c C-c</kbd>, if you are running a shell inside Emacs).
</p>
</li><li> You can tell TeX to stop this run by typing <kbd class="kbd">x <kbd class="key">RET</kbd></kbd>
at the &lsquo;<samp class="samp">?</samp>&rsquo; prompt.
</li></ol>

<p>If you are running TeX inside Emacs, you need to switch to the shell
buffer and line at which TeX offers the &lsquo;<samp class="samp">?</samp>&rsquo; prompt.
</p>
<p>Sometimes TeX will format a file without producing error messages even
though there is a problem.  This usually occurs if a command is not ended
but TeX is able to continue processing anyhow.  For example, if you fail
to end an itemized list with the <code class="code">@end itemize</code> command, TeX will
write a DVI file that you can print out.  The only error message that
TeX will give you is the somewhat mysterious comment:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">(@end occurred inside a group at level 1)
</pre></div>

<p>However, if you print the DVI file, you will find that the text
of the file that follows the itemized list is entirely indented as if
it were part of the last item in the itemized list.  The error message
is the way TeX says that it expected to find an <code class="code">@end</code>
command somewhere in the file; but that it could not determine where
it was needed.
</p>
<p>Another source of notoriously hard-to-find errors is a missing
<code class="code">@end group</code> command.  If you ever are stumped by
incomprehensible errors, look for a missing <code class="code">@end group</code> command
first.
</p>
<p>If the Texinfo file lacks header lines,
TeX may stop in the
beginning of its run and display output that looks like the following.
The &lsquo;<samp class="samp">*</samp>&rsquo; indicates that TeX is waiting for input.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">This is TeX, Version 3.14159 (Web2c 7.0)
(test.texinfo [1])
*
</pre></div>

<p>In this case, simply type <kbd class="kbd">\end <kbd class="key">RET</kbd></kbd> after the asterisk.  Then
write the header lines in the Texinfo file and run the TeX command
again. (Note the use of the backslash, &lsquo;<samp class="samp">\</samp>&rsquo;.  TeX uses &lsquo;<samp class="samp">\</samp>&rsquo;
instead of &lsquo;<samp class="samp">@</samp>&rsquo;; and in this circumstance, you are working
directly with TeX, not with Texinfo.)
