To build the provided examples you have to execute the following
commands:

  autoreconf -fi
  ./configure --with-docbook-stylesheets=DIR
  make

The '--with-docbook-stylesheets' option is required for building the
manuals using 'xsltproc'.  The stylesheets are found using DIR; the file
"DIR/epub3/chunk.xsl" needs to exist.  For example, on Fedora 25 path
can be "/usr/share/sgml/docbook/xsl-ns-stylesheets", while on Debian
use "/usr/share/xml/docbook/stylesheet/docbook-xsl-ns".

note: The Makefile doesn't support out of tree build.

See the "HACKING" file for information about the development of this
