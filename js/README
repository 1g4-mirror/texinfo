To build the provided examples you have to execute the following
commands:

  autoreconf -fi
  ./configure --with-docbook-stylesheet=DIR
  make

The '--with-docbook-stylesheet' option is required for building the
manuals using 'xsltproc'.  The stylesheets are found using DIR; the file
"DIR/epub3/chunk.xsl" needs to exist.  For example, on Fedora 25 path
can be "/usr/share/sgml/docbook/xsl-ns-stylesheets", while on Debian
use "/usr/share/xml/docbook/stylesheet/docbook-xsl-ns".

note: The Makefile doesn't support out of tree build.

To check the result of EXAMPLE:

  firefox examples/EXAMPLE-html/index.html

When modifying the 'info.js' source we recommend that you lint your
code with 'make lint'.  This command requires 'eslint' which must be
fetched with 'npm install' or 'yarn' in this directory.
