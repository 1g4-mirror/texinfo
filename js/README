To build the Kawa example you have to execute the following commands:

  autoreconf -fi
  ./configure
  make build-kawa

To check the result:

  firefox examples/kawa/index.html

When modifying the 'info.js' source we recommend that you lint your
code with 'make lint'.  This command requires 'eslint' which must be
fetched with 'npm install' in this directory.
