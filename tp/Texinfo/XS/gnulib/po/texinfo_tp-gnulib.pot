#. TRANSLATORS:
#. Get translations for open and closing quotation marks.
#. The message catalog should translate "`" to a left
#. quotation mark suitable for the locale, and similarly for
#. "'".  For example, a French Unicode local should translate
#. these to U+00AB (LEFT-POINTING DOUBLE ANGLE
#. QUOTATION MARK), and U+00BB (RIGHT-POINTING DOUBLE ANGLE
#. QUOTATION MARK), respectively.
#.
#. If the catalog has no translation, we will try to
#. use Unicode U+2018 (LEFT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK) and
#. Unicode U+2019 (RIGHT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK).  If the
#. current locale is not Unicode, locale_quoting_style
#. will quote 'like this', and clocale_quoting_style will
#. quote "like this".  You should always include translations
#. for "`" and "'" even if U+2018 and U+2019 are appropriate
#. for your locale.
#.
#. If you don't know what to put here, please see
#. <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_marks_in_other_languages>
#. and use glyphs suitable for your language.
