Delayed bugs
============

In @inline* ignore arguments, @value and user macros should not be
expanded.  For example

 @set closebrace }

 @inlinefmt{html,
 truc @value{closebrace}
 machin

In Plaintext, @quotation text should have the right margin narrowed.

Text after @bye should be kept as is when redoing Texinfo.

Sorting of index entries should be locale dependent and sort properly
unicode sorting.
my $collator = Unicode::Collate::Locale->new('locale' => $locale_name, 'normalization' => 'NFKD')
@sorted = $collator->sort(@not_sorted);


Some dubious nesting could be warned against.  The parsers context
command stacks could be used for that.

Some erroneous constructs not already warned against:

 @chapter @code{@anchor{TTO}}

 @chapter @anchor{TTez}

 @table in @menu

 @caption in @caption

 nested footnotes

 @example
 @heading A heading
 @end example
 Example in heading/heading_in_example.

 @group outside of @example  (maybe there is no need for command stack for this one
                              if @group can only appear directly in @example).

maybe checking for incorrectly nested @titlepage, @copying and
@documentdescription (which is already done in the "regions stack")
could be done the same way.


There is no warning with a block command between @def* and @def*x,
only for paragraph.  Not sure that this can be detected with
the context command stack.

 @defun a b c d e f

 @itemize @minus
 truc
 @item t
 @end itemize

 @defunx g h j k l m

 @end defun



Punctuation and spaces before @image do not lead to a doubling of space.
In fact @image is completly formatted outside of usual formatting containers.
Not sure what should be the right way?
test in info_test/image_and_punctuation

There should be a warning for block commands without argument
that have an argument on their line, like:
@blockcmd text
...

Image on sectioning command line haven't their length ignored correctly.
Not sure it is a big deal.  An example in sectioning/at_commands_in_refs.

warn when a @noindent/@indent appears within a paragraph.

in info_tests/error_in_footnote there is an error message for each 
listoffloats;  Line numbers are right, though, so maybe this is not
an issue.

converters_tests/things_before_setfilename there is no error
for anchor and footnote before setfilename.  It is not completly
clear that there should be, though.

Recursive expansion of @value may lead to an infinite loop.  Wait for
marksource to proceed.
 https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=744878


Some @-commands do not have an element with a class associated, or the
association is not perfect.  There is @author in @quotation, @-command
affected by @definfoenclose.  @pxref and similar @-commands have no class
for references to external nodes, and don't have the 'See ' in the
element for references to internal nodes.


Missing tests
=============

Test node files that differ only in case.  This may be rather complicated,
however, as http://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?38380 shows.  This may be linked
to a possible test of CASE_INSENSITIVE_FILENAMES.

Unit test of end_line_count for Texinfo/Convert/Paragraph.pm .... containers.

anchor in flushright, on an empty line, with a current byte offset.

Future features
===============

Update Unicode-EastAsianWidth.  The new version has improved tests
and a new license, but no functional change.  So maybe wait a
bit to update.

Add some elements of texinfo that are not of interest in the
tree, like beginning and end of included file, @ protecting
end of line in @def*, begin and end of user defined macro
or value expansion.  For @include @-commands, which are kept,
the type is set to 'replaced'.  Could add 'sourcemark'
instead of 'type' for the marks that are not associated with
@-commands.

In a similar way, keep the information about aliases in the tree?
And about @setfilename in included files which is for now completly
removed (consistently with documentation).

Right now VERBOSE is almost not used.

Handle better @exdent in html? (there is a FIXME in the code)

Implement what is proposed in HTML Cross Reference Mismatch.

Protection of punctuation in nodes.
in @ref. First : is searched.  if followed by a : the node name is found
and there is no label. When parsing a node a filename with ( is searched for.
Nested parentheses are taken into account.
Then more parentheses?

Automatic generation of node names from section names.  To be protected:
* in every case
  ( at the beginning
* In @node line
  commas
* In menu entry
  * if there is a label
    tab comma dot
  * if there is no label
    :
* In @ref
  commas

In Info

Nodes:
* in every case 
  ( at the beginning
* in Node line 
  commas
* In menu entry and *Note
  * if there is a label
    tab comma dot
  * if there is no label
    :

Labels in Info (which also means index entries)
  :

* at the beginning of a line in a @menu
*note more or less everywhere


DocBook
-------

  deftypevr, deftypecv: use type and not returnvalue for the type

  also informalfigure in @float

  also use informaltable or table, for multitable?

  What is before the first sectioning command is put in <bookinfo><abstract>.

  what about @titlefont in docbook?

  maybe use simpara instead of para. Indeed, simpara is for paragraph without
  block element within, and it should be that way in generated output.

  put <title> in <articleinfo>?

* in docbook, when there is only one section <article> should be better
  than book. Maybe the best way to do that would be passing the
  information that there is only one section to the functions formatting
  the page header and page footer.

  there is a mark= attribute for itemizedlist element for the initial mark
  of each item but the standard "does not specify a set of appropriate keywords"
  so it cannot be used.

Notes
=====

In january 2022 the classes in HTML elements were normalized.  There are no
rules, but here is descriptions of the choices made at that time in case one
want to use the same conventions.  The objective was to have the link between
@-commands and classes easy to understand, avoid ambiguities, and have ways to
style most of the output.

The class names without hyphen were only used for @-commands, with one
class attribute on an element maximum for each @-command appearing in the
Texinfo source.  It was also attempted to have such a class for all
the @-commands with an effect on output, though the coverage was not perfect,
sometime it is not easy to select an element that would correspond to the
most logical association with the @-command (case of @*ref @-commands with
both a <cite> and a <a href> for example).

Class names <command>-* with <command> a Texinfo @-command name were
only used for classes marking elements within an @-command but in other
elements that the main element for that @-command, in general sub elements.
For example, a @flushright lead to a <div class="flushright"> where the
@flushright command is and to <p class="flushright-paragraph"> for the
paragraphs within the @flushright.

Class names *-<command> with <command> a Texinfo @-command name were
reserved for uses related to @-command <command>.  For example
classes like summary-letter-printindex, cp-entries-printindex or
cp-letters-header-printindex for the different parts of the @printindex
formatting.

For the classes not associated with @-commands, the names were selected to
correspond to the role in the document rather than to the formatting style.


Interrogations and remarks
==========================

Should more Converter ignore the last new line (with type 
last_raw_newline) of a raw block format?

There is no forward looking code anymore, so maybe a lex/yacc parser
could be used for the main loop.  More simply, a binary tokenizer, at 
least, could make for a notable speedup.

def/end_of_lines_protected_in_footnote.pl the footnote is
   (1)  -- category: deffn_name arguments arg2 more args with end of line
and not 
   (1)
 -- category: deffn_name arguments arg2 more args with end of line
It happens this way because the paragraph starts right after the footnote 
number.

in HTML, the argument of a quotation is ignored if the quotation is empty,
as in
 @quotation thing
 @end quotation
Is it really a bug?

In @copying things like some raw formats may be expanded.  However it is
not clear that it should be the same than in the main converter.  Maybe a 
specific list of formats could be passed to Convert::Text::convert, which
would be different (for example Info and Plaintext even if converting HTML).
This requires a test, to begin with.

In HTML, HEADERS is used.  But not in other modules, especially not in
Plaintext.pm or Info.pm, this is determined by the module used (Plaintext.pm
or Info.pm).  No idea whether it is right or wrong.

in hyphenation: only text and accent commands, and should
only appear in toplevel

use definfoenclose information in Convert::Text?

From vincent Belaïche. About svg image files in HTML:

I don't think that supporting svg would be easy: its seems that to embed an
svg picture you need to declare the width x height of the frame in
which you embed it, and this information cannot be derived quite
straightforwardly from the picture.
With @image you can declare width and height but this is intended for
scaling. I am not sure whether or not that these arguments can be used
for the purpose of defining that frame...
What I did in 5x5 is that coded the height of the frame directly in
the macro @FIGURE with which I embed the figure, without going through
an argument.
The @FIGURE @macro is, for html:
@macro FIGURE {F,W}
@html
<div align="center">
<embed src="5x5_\F\.svg" height="276"
 type="image/svg+xml"
 pluginspage="http://www.adobe.com/svg/viewer/install/" /></div>
@end html
@end macro

Add @value to the corresponding commands categories?

Use of specialized synopsis in DocBook is not a priority and it is not even 
obvious that it is interesting to do so.  The following notes explain the
possibilities and issues extensively.

Instead of synopsis it might seem to be relevant to use specialized synopsis, 
funcsynopsis/funcprototype for deftype* and some def*, and other for object 
oriented.  There are many issues such that this possibility do not appear
appealing at all.

1) there is no possibility to have a category.  So the category must be 
   added somewhere as a role= or in the *synopsisinfo, or this should only
   be used for specialized @def, like @defun.

2) @defmethod and @deftypemethod cannot really be mapped to methodsynopsis
   as the class name is not associated with the method as in Texinfo, but 
   instead  the method should be in a class in docbook.

3) From the docbook reference for funcsynopsis
  "For the most part, the processing application is expected to
  generate all of the parentheses, semicolons, commas, and so on
  required in the rendered synopsis. The exception to this rule is
  that the spacing and other punctuation inside a parameter that is a
  pointer to a function must be provided in the source markup."

  So this mean it is language specific (C, as said in the docbook doc)
  and one have to remove the parentheses, semicolons, commas.

  See also the mails from Per Bothner bug-texinfo, Sun, 22 Jul 2012 01:45:54.

specialized @def, without a need for category:
@defun and @deftypefun 
<funcsynopsis><funcprototype><funcdef>TYPE <function>NAME</function><paramdef><parameter>args</parameter></paramdef></funcprototype></funcsynopsis>

specialized @def, without a need for category, but without DocBook synopsis
because of missing class:
@defmethod, @deftypemethod: methodsynopsis cannot be used since the class
is not available
@defivar and @deftypeivar: fieldsynopsis cannot be used since the class
is not available

Generic @def with a need for a category
For deffn deftypefn (and defmac?, defspec?), the possibilities of 
funcsynopsis, with a category added could be used:
  <funcsynopsis><funcprototype><funcdef role=...>TYPE <function>NAME</function></funcdef><paramdef>PARAMTYPE <parameter>PARAM</parameter></paramdef></funcprototype></funcsynopsis>

Alternatively, use funcsynopsisinfo for the category.

Generic @def with a need for a category, but without DocBook synopsis because
of missing class:
@defop and @deftypeop: methodsynopsis cannot be used since the class
is not available
defcv, deftypecv: fieldsynopsis cannot be used since the class
is not available

Remaining @def without DocBook synopsis because there is no equivalent, 
and requires a category
defvr (defvar, defopt), deftypevr (deftypevar)
deftp



Missing test outputs as files in t/
