Appendix A Copying and indices
******************************

In the appendix, we print the indices and references.

   see Copying information:: for the copying information.  see Public
domain reference:: for reference on the licence.

   see Titlepage anchor:: for the titlepage.  see Titlepage footnote
anchor:: for reference on the titlepage.

   This is a test manual, trivially and explicitly in the public
domain(1).
