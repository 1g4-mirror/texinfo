<p>Sometimes you will want to combine two disparate indices such as
functions and concepts, perhaps because you have few enough entries
that a separate index would look silly.
</p>
<p>You could put functions into the concept index by writing
<code class="code">@cindex</code> commands for them instead of <code class="code">@findex</code> commands,
and produce a consistent manual by printing the concept index with the
title &lsquo;Function and Concept Index&rsquo; and not printing the &lsquo;Function
Index&rsquo; at all; but this is not a robust procedure.  It works only if
your document is never included as part of another document that is
designed to have a separate function index; if your document were to
be included with such a document, the functions from your document and
those from the other would not end up together.  Also, to make your
function names appear in the right font in the concept index, you
would need to enclose every one of them between the braces of
<code class="code">@code</code>.
