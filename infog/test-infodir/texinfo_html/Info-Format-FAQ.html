<h3 class="section" id="Info-Format-FAQ-1">20.3 Info Format FAQ</h3>

<p>Here are some questions that have been frequently asked on
the project mailing lists and elsewhere.
</p>
<dl class="table">
<dt>Why when I run &lsquo;<samp class="samp">info <var class="var">foo</var></samp>&rsquo; do I get the same output as &lsquo;<samp class="samp">man <var class="var">foo</var></samp>&rsquo;?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Check that the Info manuals are installed.  Not all GNU/Linux
distributions install all the Info manuals by default.  This is
regrettable, as often the Info manual provides more information than
the provided man page.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Why not use HTML instead of Info?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Manuals are rarely written in the Info format itself, but are
generated from Texinfo source by the <code class="command">texi2any</code> program.
<code class="command">texi2any</code> can generate HTML as well as Info from Texinfo
source. You can also access and download HTML manuals from the GNU
website (<a class="uref" href="https://www.gnu.org/manual/manual.html">https://www.gnu.org/manual/manual.html</a>).  Additionally,
some GNU/Linux distributions provide packages for the installation
of HTML manuals.
</p>
<p>Info still has some advantages over HTML for locally installed
documentation.  The Info browsers support index lookup and support
for links between locally installed manuals in multiple locations.
It&rsquo;s important to have documentation installed locally on your machine
rather than relying on the Internet; this makes accessing documentation
more reliable, and ensures it matches installed versions of packages.
It&rsquo;s hoped that support for browsing locally installed Texinfo
documentation in some form of HTML can be improved in the future.
</p>

</dd>
<dt>Why provide the command-line <code class="command">info</code> program when it is not very good?</dt>
<dd>
<p><code class="command">info</code> has had improvements over time, so perhaps give
it another go.  It can be configured to change the default key
bindings, as well as change the color of cross-references and search
results, and to enable mouse scrolling support.  You should not
need to be experienced with the Emacs editor to use <code class="command">info</code>.
(Some recommend another program called <code class="command">pinfo</code>, but this
lacks in important features like index lookup.)
</p>
<p>Some prefer to be able to scroll through the entire manual at once (as
happens with man pages), rather than being limited to a single &lsquo;node&rsquo;
of content at once.  Of course, there is no accounting for taste,
but a single, unstructured block of text becomes more awkward as a
manual becomes longer and more complicated.  (However, if you really
want to, you can view an info manual all at once in the <code class="command">less</code>
pager with &lsquo;<samp class="samp">info <var class="var">foo</var> | less</samp>&rsquo;.)
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Why do I have &lsquo;see&rsquo; appearing in front of all of my links?</dt>
<dd>
<p>By default, Emacs Info mode either changes the marker &lsquo;<samp class="samp">*note</samp>&rsquo; for
cross-references to &lsquo;see&rsquo;, or hides it completely.  Unfortunately,
there is no way to do this reliably, as both the <code class="code">@pxref</code>
and <code class="code">@ref</code> commands in Texinfo output this marker in the Info
output, and the &lsquo;see&rsquo; text is only appropriate for <code class="code">@pxref</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Yes, but how do I get a plain link, with no extra markup?</dt>
<dd>
<p>You can&rsquo;t.  Info is a plain text format that is displayed mostly as-is
in the viewers, and without the &lsquo;<samp class="samp">*note</samp>&rsquo; text there would be nothing
to mark text as a link.  Additionally, in printed output there is no
such thing as a plain link, as the page number of the target would have
to be printed somewhere.
</p>
<p>If you really want a plain link in HTML output without affecting other
output formats, you could create a macro with conditional definitions for
each output format.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Why do lines containing links appear mysteriously short?</dt>
<dd>
<p>This due to Emacs (or <code class="command">info</code> with <code class="code">hide-note-references</code>
set to &lsquo;<samp class="samp">On</samp>&rsquo;) hiding &lsquo;<samp class="samp">*note</samp>&rsquo; strings, as mentioned above.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Can the Info format be extended to support fonts, colors or reflowable text?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Any extension would be incompatible with existing Info-viewing programs.
Extra markup added to Info files would be displayed to the user, making
files ugly and unreadable.
</p>
<p>When Texinfo files are processed into Info files, information about
which Texinfo commands were used to markup text is lost.  Moreover,
it is not possible to reliably detect whether text can be reflowed
(e.g. a paragraph of prose), or whether line breaks should be kept
(e.g. a code sample, or poem).
</p>
<p>Info&rsquo;s core purpose is to display documentation on text terminals.
If you want more, you are recommended to use the HTML output from
<code class="command">texi2any</code> instead.
