<p>Richard M. Stallman invented the Texinfo format, wrote the initial
processors, and created Edition 1.0 of this manual.  Robert&nbsp;J.
Chassell greatly revised and extended the manual, starting with
Edition 1.1.  Brian Fox was responsible for the standalone Texinfo
distribution until version 3.8.  Karl Berry continued maintenance
from Texinfo 3.8 (manual edition 2.22), and Gavin Smith has continued
maintenance since Texinfo 6.0.

<h4 class="subheading" id="Beginnings">Beginnings</h4>

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-NLS"></a>
<p>Richard Stallman included an on-line, hypertext help system called
Info in the original implementation of Emacs (in 1975/6).
Stallman had been inspired after seeing a presentation a couple of years
earlier on the &ldquo;NLS&rdquo; hypertext system of Douglas Engelbart.
</p>

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-Scribe"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-Reid_002c-Brian"></a>
<p>In another development, in the 1970&rsquo;s at CMU, Brian Reid developed
a program and format named Scribe to mark up documents for printing.
It used the <code class="code">@</code> character to introduce commands, as Texinfo does.
Much more consequentially, it strove to describe document contents
rather than formatting, an idea wholeheartedly adopted by Texinfo.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-Bolio"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-BoTeX"></a>
<p>Meanwhile, people at MIT developed another format called Bolio.
Richard Stallman (RMS) worked on converting Bolio to use TeX as
its typesetting language, resulting in BoTeX.  The earliest BoTeX
version seems to have been 0.02 on October 31, 1984.
</p>
<p>BoTeX could only be used as a markup language for documents to be
printed, not for online documents.  RMS combined BoTeX and Info
to create Texinfo, a mark-up language for text that is intended to
be read both online and as printed hard copy.
</p>
<p>The original translator to create Info was written
(primarily by RMS and Bob Chassell) in Emacs Lisp, namely the
<code class="code">texinfo-format-buffer</code> and other functions.  In the early 1990s,
Brian Fox reimplemented the conversion program in C, now called
<code class="command">makeinfo</code>, as well as the standalone <code class="command">info</code> program.
</p>
<h4 class="subheading" id="Reimplementing-in-Perl">Reimplementing in Perl</h4>

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-Cons_002c-Lionel"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-Dumas_002c-Patrice"></a>
<p>In 2012, the C <code class="command">makeinfo</code> was itself replaced by a Perl
implementation generically called <code class="command">texi2any</code>.  This version
supports the same level of output customization as
<code class="command">texi2html</code>, an independent program originally written by
Lionel Cons, later with substantial work by many others.  The many
additional features needed to make <code class="command">texi2html</code> a replacement
for <code class="command">makeinfo</code> were implemented by Patrice Dumas.  The first
never-released version of <code class="command">texi2any</code> was based on the
<code class="command">texi2html</code> code.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-Tree-representation-of-documents"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-Syntax-tree-representation-of-documents"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-Abstract-syntax-tree-representation-of-documents"></a>
<p>That implementation, however, was abandoned in favor of the current
program (also written by Patrice Dumas), which parses the Texinfo
input into a tree for processing.  It inherited the design of
customization and other features from <code class="command">texi2html</code> (for more
on <code class="command">texi2html</code> compatibility, see <a class="pxref" href="texi2html.html"><code class="command">texi2html</code>: Ancestor of <code class="command">texi2any</code></a>).
However, <code class="code">texi2any</code> is a full reimplementation: it constructs
a tree-based representation of the input document for all back-ends
to work from.
</p>
<p>The new Perl program is much slower than the old C program.  The speed
gap has partially closed since first release, but it may not ever be
entirely comparable.  So why did we switch?  In short, we intend and
hope that the present program will be much easier than the previous C
implementation of <code class="command">makeinfo</code> to extend to different output
styles, back-end output formats, and all other customizations.
In more detail:
</p>
<ul class="itemize mark-bullet">
<li>HTML customization.  Many GNU and other free software packages
had been happily using the HTML customization features in
<code class="command">texi2html</code> for years.  Thus, in effect two independent
implementations of the Texinfo language had developed, and keeping
them in sync was not simple.  Adding the HTML customization possible
in <code class="command">texi2html</code> to a C program would have been an
enormous effort.

</li><li>Unicode, and multilingual support generally, especially of east
Asian languages.  Although of course it&rsquo;s perfectly plausible to write
such support in C, in the particular case of <code class="command">makeinfo</code>, it
would have been tantamount to rewriting the entire program.  In Perl,
much of that comes essentially for free.

</li><li>Additional back-ends.  The <code class="command">makeinfo</code> code had become
convoluted to the point where adding a new back-end was quite complex,
requiring complex interactions with existing back-ends.  In contrast,
our Perl implementation provides a clean tree-based representation for
all back-ends to work from.  People have requested numerous different
back-ends (LaTeX, the latest (X)HTML, &hellip;), and they will now
be much more feasible to implement.  Which leads to the last item:

</li><li>Making contributions easier.  In general, due to the cleaner
structure, the Perl program should be considerably easier than the C
for anyone to read and contribute to, with the resulting obvious
benefits.
</li></ul>

<a class="anchor" id="Reference-Implementation"></a><p><code class="command">texi2any</code> is intended to be a reference implementation
that defines parts of the language not fully specified by the manual.
Without such a reference, alternative implementations would be very
likely to have subtle, or not-so-subtle, differences in behavior,
and thus Texinfo documents would become dependent on the processor.
It is also important to have consistent command-line options for
all processors.  Extensive tests of the language and processor were
developed at the same time as <code class="command">texi2any</code>; we encourage anyone
thinking of writing a program to parse Texinfo input to make use of
these tests.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-Future-of-Texinfo-implementations"></a>
<p>With the release of <code class="command">texi2any</code> as the reference
implementation, development of both the C implementation of
<code class="command">makeinfo</code> and <code class="command">texi2html</code> has been halted.  Going
forward, we ask authors of Texinfo documents to use only
<code class="command">texi2any</code>.
