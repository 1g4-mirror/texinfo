This directory contains a SWIG (https://www.swig.org/) interface designed
to connect high-level programming languages to GNU Texinfo texi2any C code.

A preliminary build system for a Perl extension is available in the perl
directory.  This build system is not fully integrated.  First you should build
in the main directory to generate files with SWIG.  Then you should go to the
perl directory to build the Perl module using Makefile.PL:

$ make
$ cd perl
$ perl Makefile.PL
$ make
$ make test

Note also that the Perl module will not be functional if installed as
it finds the Texinfo libraries in the source directory.

Libtool hides the generated binary objects in the .libs directory.  Therefore
to find the Python module extensions from the python/ subdirectory, you can
add the .libs directory to PYTHONPATH.  For example, with bash:

$ export PYTHONPATH=.libs

In the perl directory, you can add the directories where the extension
files are with -I:

$ perl -I blib/arch/ -I blib/lib/ ./test_Texinfo.pl

In addition to the build system, this distribution includes the following
files:
    README                    This file.
    texinfo.i                 The SWIG interface file.
    python/test_Texinfo.py    Example of use of the Python interface
