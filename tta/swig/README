This directory contains a SWIG (https://www.swig.org/) interface designed
to connect high-level programming languages to GNU Texinfo texi2any C code.
The build system is integrated with the main Texinfo build system based on
autoconf, automake and libtool.

Two interfaces are available, a Python and a Perl interface.  The interfaces
are setup from the main directory, the per-language source files being created
in each language subdirectory.  The interfaces binary files are built only if
possible, if all the prerequisites are available.  They are built each in its
own subdirectory.

There is a MakeMaker based distribution in the perl directory, but it
is not suitable for installing as the relinking needed to find the Texinfo C
library is not performed.

For the Python interface, there is no built-in determination of the location of
the binary objects that are hidden by libtool in the .libs directory.  To find
the Python module extension from the python/ subdirectory to run scripts from
the build directory, you can add the .libs directory to PYTHONPATH.  For
example, with bash:

$ export PYTHONPATH=.libs

For the Perl interface, finding the Perl module and extension from the build
directory is built-in the scripts and test files.

In addition to the build and test system, this distribution includes the
following files:
    README                    This file.
    texinfo.i                 The SWIG interface file.
    python/test_Texinfo.py    Example of use of the Python interface
    perl/parse_refold.pl      Script recreating the original Texinfo code
                              based on a parsed tree
