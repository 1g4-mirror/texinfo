This directory contains a SWIG (https://www.swig.org/) interface designed
to connect high-level programming languages to GNU Texinfo texi2any C code.

Libtool hides the generated binary objects in the .libs directory.  Therefore
to find the Python module extensions from the python/ subdirectory, you can
add the .libs directory to PYTHONPATH.  For example, with bash:

$ export PYTHONPATH=.libs

In the perl directory, you can add the directories where the extension
files are with -I:

$ perl -I . -I .libs t/30source_marks.t

In addition to the build and test system, this distribution includes the
following files:
    README                    This file.
    texinfo.i                 The SWIG interface file.
    python/test_Texinfo.py    Example of use of the Python interface
