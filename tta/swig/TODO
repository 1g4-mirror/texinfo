Documentation

set_document_options: set novalidate, documentlanguage
(and OUTPUT_ENCODING_NAME and possibly other based on OPTIONS_LIST
arguments, but there is no interface for OPTIONS_LIST).  Not sure that
it is a good thing to document OUTPUT_ENCODING_NAME, as it could be confusing
as the encoding of output is always UTF-8.

For Perl, SWIG generated code builds an SV from a string using sv_setpvn.
According to documentation, this means:
copy a string into the SV sv, making sure it is "SvPOK_only".
SvPOK_only tells an SV that it is a string and disables all other OK bits.
Will also turn off the UTF-8 status.

The strings returned should therefore be considered as byte strings by Perl.
They are also always UTF-8 encoded as the C code converts all the strings
in the tree to UTF-8.  In Perl code it therefore should be possible to convert 
to characters by calling:
$result = Encode::decode('UTF-8', $strings_from_tree);

Also note that, although it may change, it is possible for Texinfo
document encoding US-ASCII to be interpreted as ISO-8859-1 for non-ASCII
characters.  This could be relevant in particular when one wants to convert
to the input encoding.  In that case, if the input encoding name is US-ASCII
it could be safer to actually convert to ISO-8859-1.


Example of code to test some functions:

element = skip_to_cmdname(reader, 'node')

element = skip_to_cmdname(reader, 'cindex')
index_entry = Texinfo.element_index_entry (document, element)
index_info = Texinfo.index_entry_index (document, index_entry)
