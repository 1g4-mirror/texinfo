Add tests of pod2texi.pl.  The tests of the module are fine, but in
pod2texi.pl the Texinfo output is completed with menus and modified to
be valid Texinfo, which mobilize code that is not tested in that
configuration.

It is not clear how this can be done in Perl modules infrastructure,
but it could be done with automake infrastructure.

Tests in manual_tests/ should be in the test suite.
