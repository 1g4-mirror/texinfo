   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

Pod::Simple::PullParser, Texinfo::Parser.  

DISTRIBUTION SETUP

This module is usually distributed as part of GNU Texinfo, using Autoconf
and Automake for the build system.  Alternatively, it is possible to
distribute the module using Makefile.PL as described here.

The pod2texi script is usually set up using the Autoconf and Automake
built environment from pod2texi.pl.  When using Makefile.PL from version
control sources, pod2texi.pl file should be copied instead, as explained above.
In that case, the Texinfo::Parser modules will not be searched for as in the
GNU Texinfo usual case, only in the perl paths, as in other perl modules.
