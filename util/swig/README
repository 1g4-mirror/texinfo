This directory contains a SWIG (https://www.swig.org/) interface designed
to connect high-level programming language to GNU Texinfo texi2any C code.

A full build system example based on autoconf, automake and libtool is
provided for Python as a language target.  This build system is not
independent from GNU Texinfo as header files and libtool archive files
from the GNU Texinfo tta directory are used to build and link, since the header
files and associated libraries are not public.

A preliminary build system for a Perl extension is also available in the perl
directory.  This build system is not fully integrated.  First you should build
in the main directory to generate files with SWIG.  Then you should go to the
perl directory to build the Perl module using Makefile.PL:

$ make
$ cd perl
$ perl Makefile.PL
$ make
$ make test

Note also that the Perl module will not be functional if installed as
it finds the Texinfo libraries in the source directory.

The build system uses Python and SWIG autoconf-archive related macros
(http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf-archive): AX_PYTHON_DEVEL,
AX_PKG_SWIG, AX_SWIG_PYTHON.  You should make sure that they can be found
by autoreconf.

The build system can be bootstrapped by calling
./autogen.sh

Libtool hides the generated binary objects in the .libs directory.  Therefore
to find the Python module extensions from the python/ subdirectory, you can
add the .libs directory to PYTHONPATH.  For example, with bash:

$ export PYTHONPATH=.libs

In the perl directory, you can add the directories where the extension
files are with -I:

$ perl -I blib/arch/ -I blib/lib/ ./test_Texinfo.pl

In addition to the build system, this distribution includes the following
files:
    README                    This file.
    texinfo.i                 The SWIG interface file.
    python/test_Texinfo.py    Example of use of the Python interface
