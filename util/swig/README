This directory contains a SWIG (https://www.swig.org/) interface designed
to connect high-level programming language to GNU Texinfo texi2any C code.

A full build system example based on autoconf, automake and libtool is
provided with Python as a language target.  This build system is not
independent from GNU Texinfo as header files and libtool archive files
from the GNU Texinfo tta directory are used to build and link, since the header
files and associated libraries are not public.

Libtool hides the generated binary objects in the .libs directory.  Therefore
to find the Python module extensions, you can add the .libs directory to
PYTHONPATH.  For example, with bash:

$ export PYTHONPATH=.libs

To find the libraries, you should call libtool to run Python codes that
import the Texinfo module:

$ libtool exec ./test_Texinfo.py

In addition to the build system, this distribution includes the following
files:
    README                 This file.
    texinfo.i              The SWIG interface file.
    tree_element.c         Wrappers used in texinfo.i.
    tree_element.h
    test_Texinfo.py        Example of use of the Python interface
